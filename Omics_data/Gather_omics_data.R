# Gather public kidney datasets to check if we have genes that overlap.
# The data sets collected are the following:
##  HKUPP and UPDB refered in the Papadopoulos et al. paper.
##  Proteomics dataset from Col4a3 KO mice in Muckova paper.
##  Rinchen proteomics datasets: Isolated rat podocytes from induced kidney damage, human
##  podocyte cell line with induced damage.

# Extensive records should be kept to make sure we interpret data correctly.
