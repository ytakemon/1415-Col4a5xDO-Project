# RNA_seq README
This directory contains all scripts that pertains to RNA-Seq analysis. 

[**Correlation:**](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/1415-Col4a5xDO-Project/tree/master/RNA_seq/Correlation) Correlation of TPMs calcualted from from RNA-Seq civet output. <br />
[**Isoform_expression:**](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/1415-Col4a5xDO-Project/tree/master/RNA_seq/Isoform_expression) Plot all isoforms of transcript to identify what is expressed. <br /> 
[**eQTL:**](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/1415-Col4a5xDO-Project/tree/master/RNA_seq/eQTL) Like it says, eQTL analysis utilizing RNA-seq TPM values. <br />
