#GWAS_candidate_discover Readme
This directory contains R scripts used for:
* Gwas plotting.
* Allele effect plot (should really be with QTL scripts).
* Genes under peaks.

#Description of Scripts
###[GWAS_ACR.R](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/1415-Col4a5xDO-Project/blob/master/GWAS_Candidate_discovery/GWAS%20ACR%20.R)
* Using best.genoprobs.192.Rdata.
* GWAS assocaition plotting for ACR and Albumin with sex and creainine as covariates.
* GWAS permutation is broken, thus includes script for manual run.
* Genes under peaks.
* Coefficient allele effect plot.
* Bayesian interval.

###[GWAS_C2.GFR_Candiates.R](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/1415-Col4a5xDO-Project/blob/master/GWAS_Candidate_discovery/GWAS_C2.GFR_Candiates.R)
* Using best.genoprobs.192.Rdata
* GWAS assocaition plotting for GFR using sex as a covariate.
* GWAS permutation is broken, thus includes script for manual run.
* Genes under peaks.
* Coefficient allele effect plot.
* Bayesian interval.
