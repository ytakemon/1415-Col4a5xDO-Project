#GWAS_candidate_discover Readme
This directory contains R scripts used for:
* Gwas plotting.
* Allele effect plot (should really be with QTL scripts).
* Genes under peaks.

#Description of Scripts
###GWAS_ACR.R
* Using best.genoprobs.192.Rdata.
* GWAS assocaition plotting for ACR and Albumin with sex and creainine as covariates.
* GWAS permutation is broken, thus includes script for manual run.
* Genes under peaks.
* Coefficient allele effect plot.
* Bayesian interval.

###GWAS_C2.GFR_Candiates.R
* Using best.genoprobs.192.Rdata
* GWAS assocaition plotting for GFR using sex as a covariate.
* GWAS permutation is broken, thus includes script for manual run.
* Genes under peaks.
* Coefficient allele effect plot.
* Bayesian interval.
