Alport Syndrome (AS) is a hereditary disease affecting 1 in 5,000 births
in the United States^1^. Children and young adults with AS suffer from
hearing loss, vision abnormalities, and most notably kidney disease^2^.
AS patients with kidney disease are diagnosed with glomerulonephritis,
and present with symptoms of hematuria and proteinuria. Inevitably,
their kidney functions progressively deteriorate and lead to End-Stage
Renal Failure (ESRF) ^2^. It is well studied that ESRF in AS is caused
by genetic mutations in the α3, α4, and α5 chains of type IV collagen,
which are encoded by *COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5*. In the kidney, the
three type IV collagen proteins form heterotrimers and are exclusively
found in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM)^3^. The lack of type IV
collagen proteins causes the GBM to weaken and distend, and podocytes
foot process effacement is also observed (REFERENCE). COL4A5 is the only
type IV collagen protein encoded on the X chromosome, and is responsible
for 80% of AS diagnosis. As the X-linkage suggests, males that are
hemizygous to the *COL4A5* mutation are disproportionally affected
compared to females. Males have an earlier onset and increased severity
of the disease, with 50% of patients requiring dialysis or kidney
transplants due to ESRF by the age of 25 and 100% by the age of 60^4^.
On the other hand females that are heterozygous for this X-linked AS
have relatively later onset with only 12% developing ESRF by the age of
40 and 40% at the age of 80 years^5^. However, patients do not all
present the disease in a similar manner, and studies have observed their
age of onset and severity to be highly variable^4^.

In the 2015 International Workshop on AS, clinicians and researchers
highlighted the need for an effective cure for AS^6^. Currently the only
treatment option for AS patients is Angiotensin-converting-enzyme
inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors), which is primarily used as treatment for
hypertension^4^. Treatment with ACE-inhibitors are able to alleviate the
mechanical pressures applied to the fragile GMB of AS patients and delay
onset of ESRF, however treatment efficacy is highly dependent on
timing^6,7^. In addition to the lack of treatment options, we still do
not have a target for therapeutic interventions. Although *Col4a5* is
known to cause AS, it is a poor therapeutic target as the disease
progression vary dramatically. The varying age of onset and severity of
AS suggests possibilities of other underlying mechanisms that are able
to modify disease progression caused by the *Col4a5*
mutation. Identifying these mechanisms and the genes involved may lead
to the development of precise and novel therapeutic targets.

To our knowledge there has only been one study conducted to identify
modifier genes that lead to the variability in age of onset and severity
of AS^8^. They observed variation between *Col4a3* knock out mice in
129X1/SvJ and C57BL/6J backgrounds, and identified 2 quantitative trail
loci (QTL) on chromosome 9 and 16, however the intervals were not narrow
enough to confidently identify probable candidate genes^8^.

In this study we aimed to identify modifier genes of X-linked AS by
introducing the *Col4a5* mutation into a diverse genetic background
using the Diversity Outbred (DO) mice ^9-11^. DO mice are derived from
eight inbred founder strains (A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/LtJ,
NZO/HlLtJ, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ), which captured nearly 90% of
the known genetic variation present in laboratory mice^12^. This
heterogeneity observed in the DO population is currently the best model
that reflects the genetic diversity in the human population. (Ending
